Hello new team.

This project is based off of amoung other things the following
CodeIgnighter: http://codeigniter.com/
Grocery CRUD: http://www.grocerycrud.com/
php-active record: http://www.phpactiverecord.org/

it also uses the following but they are not as important
fancybox
jquery
ag_auth (heavily modiefied does not look like ag_auth any more)

there is one function in the admin controller that still uses CarboGrid and should be ported to grocery crud
/application/controllers/admin.php/manageWaitlist()
its view is located in the views folder

as a result there are a bunch of carbogrid files still

when you take over the project email Justin
for control of the google group
and to ask questions
